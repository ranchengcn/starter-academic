	abstract = {Most evolutionary algorithms, including particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, involve at least one population (swarm) to realize information exchange or information sharing among different individuals. To enhance the algorithms' global search ability, several multi-swarm PSO algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, a novel multi-swarm evolutionary framework based on a feedback mechanism is introduced. The framework consists of a search operator similar to those in PSO and a mutation strategy, on the top of the feedback mechanism. The framework is compared with a multi-swarm PSO and the canonical PSO on a few widely used benchmarks to demonstrate its performance.},

Different from the canonical particle swarm optimizer (PSO), neither gbest nor pbest needs to be stored in ComPSO, and the algorithm is extremely simple in implementation. ComPSO has shown to be highly scalable to the search dimension. In the original ComPSO, two particles are randomly chosen to compete. This work investigates the influence of the competition rule on the search performance of ComPSO and proposes a new competition rule operating on a sorted swarm with neighborhood control. Empirical studies have been performed on a set of widely used test functions to compare the new competition rule with the random strategy. Results show that the new competition rule can speed up the convergence with a big neighborhood size, while with a small neighborhood size, the convergence speed can be slowed down.},

	abstract = {Inverse model based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm aims to sample candidate solutions directly in the objective space, which makes it easier to control the diversity of non-dominated solutions in multiobjective optimization. To facilitate the process of inverse modeling, the objective space is partitioned into several subregions by predefining a set of reference vectors. In the previous work, the reference vectors are uniformly distributed in the objective space. Uniformly distributed reference vectors, however, may not be efficient for problems that have nonuniform or disconnected Pareto fronts. To address this issue, an adaptive reference vector generation strategy is proposed in this work. The basic idea of the proposed strategy is to adaptively adjust the reference vectors according to the distribution of the candidate solutions in the objective space. The proposed strategy consists of two phases in the search procedure. In the first phase, the adaptive strategy promotes the population diversity for better exploration, while in the second phase, the strategy focused on convergence for better exploitation. To assess the performance of the proposed strategy, empirical simulations are carried out on two DTLZ benchmark problems, namely, DTLZ5 and DTLZ7, which have a degenerate and a disconnected Pareto front, respectively. Our results show that the proposed adaptive reference vector strategy is promising in tacking multiobjective optimization problems whose Pareto front is disconnected.},

	doi = {10.1109/CEC.2015.7256991},
	abstract = {Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) usually achieve a set of nondominated solutions as the approximation of the Pareto front. In order to utilize the solutions, a final decision making process is indispensable in most cases in which a small number of solutions have to be selected. In this process a decision maker selects the solutions according to his or her preferences or based on the knowledge acquired by observing the approximated Pareto front. Due to the limited number of solutions an algorithm can obtain, in particular when the number of objectives is large, a decision maker may be interested in sampling additional solutions in some preferred regions. This paper proposes to use a reference vector based preference articulation (RVPA) method to obtain such additional solutions in preferred regions. After describing the proposed method in detail, experiments are conducted on six benchmark MOPs to assess the performance of the proposed RVPA method. Our empirical results show that, by setting reference vectors in the objective space, the proposed RVPA is able to obtain corresponding solutions in the preferred regions at a much lower cost compared to e.g. a re-start strategy. In addition, by setting the reference vectors in a uniform way, the proposed RVPA method is also able to improve the general quality (convergence and distribution) of the solutions obtained by an MOEA.},

This paper investigates structural optimization of networks in the highlevel classification context, where the classification produced by a traditional classifier is combined with the classification provided by complex network measures. Using the recently proposed social learning particle swarm optimization (SL-PSO), a bio-inspired optimization framework, which is responsible to build up the network and adjust the parameters of the hybrid model while conducting the optimization of a quality function, is proposed. Experiments on two real-world problems, the Handwritten Digits Recognition and the Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), were performed. In both problems, the optimization framework is able to improve the classification given by a state-of-the-art algorithm to SRL. Furthermore, the optimization framework proposed here can be extended to other machine learning tasks.},

	abstract = {Social learning plays an important role in behavior learning among social animals. Different from individual (asocial) learning, social learning has the advantage of allowing individuals to learn behaviors from others without the extra costs of individual trial-and-error. Inspired by the natural social learning phenomenon, we have transplanted the social learning mechanism into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to develop a social learning PSO (SL-PSO). Unlike classical PSO variants, the SL-PSO is performed on a sorted swarm, and instead of merely learning from historical best positions, the particles are able to learn from anyone better (demonstrators) in the current swarm. A key mechanism in the SL-PSO is the learning strategy, where an imitator will learn from different demonstrators. However, in our previous work, little discussion has been focused on demonstrator selection, i.e., which demonstrators are to learn from by the imitator. In this paper, based on the analysis of the demonstrator selection in the SL-PSO, two demonstrator selection strategies are proposed. Experimental results show that, the proposed demonstrator selection strategies have significantly enhanced the performance of the SL-PSO in comparison to five representative PSO variants on a set of benchmark problems.},

	abstract = {Non-dominated sorting has been widely adopted in evolutionary multi-objective optimization. Many approaches to non-dominated sorting have been proposed to improve its computational efficiency, but unfortunately, most of them still suffer from high computational cost, especially when the number of objectives becomes large. A tree-based efficient non-dominated sorting approach, termed T-ENS, has been recently developed by us for many-objective optimization, where a tree structure is adopted to represent solutions, such that the non-dominance relationship between solutions can be easily inferred from the position of the solutions in the tree, thereby considerably reducing the number of comparisons between solutions belonging to the same non-dominated front. To validate the computational efficiency of T-ENS, this paper provides a detailed empirical analysis by comparing T-ENS with the state-of-the-art approaches, in particular when the number of objectives is larger than three and the population size becomes large. Empirical results indicate that the T-ENS is well suited for evolutionary many-objective optimization and large-scale multi-objective optimization, where either the number of objectives or the population size is large.},

However, in actual industrial processes, it is usually very difficult to build up precise mathematical models to describe complex industrial processes due to the lack of clear mechanisms. Instead, only some noisy historical data can be used, and optimization of such problem is often known as data-driven optimization. The optimization of complex beneficiation operational process is a typical data-driven optimization problem. To solve this problem, an evolutionary algorithm assisted by Gaussian process model is proposed in this paper. To be specific, a low-order neural network model is constructed by using the data collected from mineral processing factory as real objective function, and a Gaussian process model is developed as a surrogate to reduce the number of real function evaluations. We test the new method on a series of multi-objective test instances against two other algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method has the ability to achieve significant improvement at the limited budget of real function evaluations. In addition, the proposed algorithm is also successfully applied to the optimization of complex beneficiation operational process.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visualization method in the multimodal optimization area. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed parallel peaks method can be robustly used to visualize candidate solutions sets with a range of properties, including high-accuracy solutions sets, high-dimensional solution sets and solution sets with a large number of optima. Additionally, by visualizing the populations obtained during the optimization process, it can also be used to investigate search behaviors of multimodal optimization algorithms.},

However, not much work has been done to investigate the method for sampling reference points on Pareto fronts, even though it is not an easy task for many Pareto fronts with irregular shapes. More recently, an evolutionary multi-objective optimization platform was proposed by us, called PlatEMO, which can automatically generate reference points on each Pareto front and use them to calculate the performance metric values.

In 2017, we proposed the evolutionary multi-objective optimization platform PlatEMO to facilitate the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), where some delicate techniques were developed to improve the computational efficiency of MOEAs. These techniques have not been introduced before, since users need not care about them when using existing MOEAs or developing new MOEAs. To deepen the understanding of the core mechanisms of PlatEMO, this paper gives a comprehensive introduction to these techniques, including new non-dominated sorting approaches, matrix calculation, and parallel computing.

In this paper, an SAEA with Dimension Dropout is proposed to solve high-dimensional EMOPs. At each iteration of the proposed algorithm, it randomly selects a part of the decision variables by Dimension Dropout, and then optimizes the selected decision variables with the assistance of surrogate models. To balance the convergence and diversity, those candidate solutions with good diversity are modified by replacing the selected decision variables with those optimized ones (i.e., decision variables from some better-converged candidate solutions). Eventually, the new candidate solutions are evaluated using expensive functions to update the archive. Empirical studies on ten benchmark problems with up to 200 decision variables demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Despite that a number of large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (LSMOEAs) have been proposed in recent years, their effectiveness in solving LSMOPs remains unsatisfactory. One main reason is that most existing LSMOEAs may fail to balance convergence enhancement and diversity maintenance, especially for solving real-world problems. To address this issue, we propose to use a hybridized LSMOEA with adaptive operator selection (AOS) to handle real-world LSMOPs. Specifically, the proposed hybridized LSMOEA with AOS (AOS-LSMOEA) includes multiple different offspring generation and environmental selection strategies extracted from some existing LSMOEAs. Then it uses the AOS to adaptively determine the application rates of different offspring generation and environmental selection operators in an online manner. The proposed approach is capable of taking advantage of existing LSMOEAs, and the AOS enables the algorithm to choose suitable operators for solving different LSMOPs.

In this article, we adopt the concept of manifold and propose a manifold learning-inspired mating strategy to enhance the diversity maintenance in MOEAs for solving MOP-cPS efficiently. In the proposed strategy, all of the individuals are first clustered into different manifolds according to their distribution in the objective space, and then the mating reproduction is restricted among individuals in the same manifold. Moreover, we embed the proposed mating strategy in three representative MOEAs and compare the embedded MOEAs with their original versions using the assortative genetic operators on a variety of MOP-cPS. The experimental results demonstrate the significant performance improvements benefitting from the proposed mating restriction strategy.},

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are naturally suitable for multiobjective optimization due to their population-based property, allowing the search of optima simultaneously. Nevertheless, LSMOPs are challenging for conventional EAs, mainly due to the huge volume of search space in LSMOPs. Thus, it is important to explore the impact of the population sizing on the performance of conventional multiobjective EAs (MOEAs) in solving LSMOPs. In this work, we compare several representative MOEAs with different settings of population sizes on some transformer ratio error estimation (TREE) problems in the power system. These test cases are defined on combinations of three population sizes, three TREE problems, and five MOEAs. Our results indicate that the performances of conventional MOEAs with different population sizes in solving LSMOPs are different. The impact of population sizing is most significant for differential evolution based and particle swarm based MOEAs.},

The main idea is to track the Pareto optimal set (PS) directly via problem reformulation. To begin with, the algorithm obtains a set of reference directions in the decision space and associates them with a set of weight variables for locating the PS. Afterwards, the original large-scale multiobjective optimization problem is reformulated into a low-dimensional single-objective optimization problem. In the reformulated problem, the decision space is reconstructed by the weight variables and the objective space is reduced by an indicator function. Thanks to the low dimensionality of the weight variables and reduced objective space, a set of quasi-optimal solutions can be obtained efficiently. Finally, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is used to spread the quasi-optimal solutions over the approximate Pareto optimal front evenly. Experiments have been conducted on a variety of large-scale multiobjective problems with up to 5000 decision variables. Four different types of representative algorithms are embedded into the proposed framework and compared with their original versions, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been compared with two state-of-the-art algorithms for large-scale multiobjective optimization.

When the number of objectives or decision variables is scaled up in CMOPs, the performance of EAs may degenerate dramatically and may fail to obtain any feasible solutions. To address this issue, we propose a paired offspring generation-based multiobjective EA for constrained large-scale optimization. The general idea is to emphasize the role of offspring generation in reproducing some promising feasible or useful infeasible offspring solutions. We first adopt a small set of reference vectors for constructing several subpopulations with a fixed number of neighborhood solutions. Then, a pairing strategy is adopted to determine some pairwise parent solutions for offspring generation. Consequently, the pairwise parent solutions, which could be infeasible, may guide the generation of well-converged solutions to cross the infeasible region(s) effectively. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on CMOPs with up to 1000 decision variables and ten objectives. Moreover, each component in the proposed algorithm is examined in terms of its effect on the overall algorithmic performance.

So far, a variety of evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to solve many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) with more than three objectives. Most of the existing algorithms, however, find difficulties in simultaneously counterpoising convergence and diversity during the whole evolutionary process. To address the issue, this paper proposes to solve MaOPs via multistage evolutionary search. To be specific, a two-stage evolutionary algorithm is developed, where the convergence and diversity are highlighted during different search stages to avoid the interferences between them. The first stage pushes multiple subpopulations with different weight vectors to converge to different areas of the Pareto front. After that, the nondominated solutions coming from each subpopulation are selected for generating a new population for the second stage. Moreover, a new environmental selection strategy is designed for the second stage to balance the convergence and diversity close to the Pareto front. This selection strategy evenly divides each objective dimension into a number of intervals, and then one solution having the best convergence in each interval will be retained. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, 48 benchmark functions with 7, 10, and 15 objectives are used to make comparisons with five representative many-objective optimization algorithms.},

They are used to generate target wall Mach distributions for the inverse design that matches specified features, such as locations of suction peak, shock and aft loading. Qualitative and quantitative results show that both adopted generative models can generate diverse and realistic wall Mach number distributions satisfying the given features. The CVAE-GAN model outperforms the CVAE model and achieves better reconstruction accuracies for all the samples in the dataset. Furthermore, a deep neural network for nonlinear mapping is adopted to obtain the airfoil shape corresponding to the target wall Mach number distribution. The performances of the designed deep neural network are fully demonstrated and a smoothness measurement is proposed to quantify small oscillations in the airfoil surface, proving the authenticity and accuracy of the generated airfoil shapes.},

The use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for community detection in large-scale networks has gained considerable popularity because these algorithms are fairly effective in networks with a relatively small number of nodes. In this paper, we propose a parallel multi-objective EA, called PMOEA, for community detection in large-scale networks, where the communities associated with key network nodes are detected in parallel. Specifically, we develop a multi-objective and a single-objective EA. The former is used to detect the communities of a key node instead of all communities in the network. The latter obtains the communities in the entire network using the previously detected communities of each key node. The performance of the proposed method was verified on both large-scale synthetic benchmark networks and real-world networks. The results demonstrated the superiority of PMOEA over six EA-based and two non-EA-based community-detection algorithms for large-scale networks.},

Some recent algorithms work well when dealing with CMOPs with a simple feasible region; however, the effectiveness of most algorithms degrades considerably for CMOPs with complex feasible regions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-stage evolutionary algorithm, where constraints are added one after the other and handled in different stages of evolution. Specifically, in the early stages, the algorithm only considers a small number of constraints, which can make the population efficiently converge to the potential feasible region with good diversity. As the algorithm moves to the later stages, more constraints are considered to search the optimal solutions based on the solutions obtained in the previous stages. Furthermore, a strategy for sorting the constraint-handling priority according to the impact on the unconstrained Pareto front is proposed, which can accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Experimental results on five benchmark suites and three real-world applications showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art constraint multi-objective evolutionary algorithms when dealing with CMOPs, especially for problems with complex constraints.},

To address this issue, this article proposes a computationally efficient framework for the evolutionary search of convolutional networks based on a directed acyclic graph, in which parents are randomly sampled and trained on each mini-batch of training data. In addition, a node inheritance strategy is adopted so that the fitness of all offspring individuals can be evaluated without training them.

Three factors affect this significantly: 1) the exclusion mechanisms to avoid the convergence to the same peak by multiple subpopulations; 2) the resource allocation mechanism that assigns the computational resources to the subpopulations; and 3) the control mechanisms to adaptively adjust the number of subpopulations by considering the number of optima and available computational resources. In the existing exclusion mechanisms, when the distance (i.e., the distance between their best found positions) between two subpopulations becomes less than a predefined threshold, the inferior one will be removed/reinitialized. However, this leads to incapability of algorithms in covering peaks/optima that are closer than the threshold. Moreover, despite the importance of resource allocation due to the limited available computational resources between environmental changes, it has not been well studied in the literature. Finally, the number of subpopulations should be adapted to the number of optima. However, in most existing adaptive multipopulation methods, there is no predefined upper bound for generating subpopulations. Consequently, in problems with large numbers of peaks, they can generate too many subpopulations sharing limited computational resources. In this article, a multipopulation framework is proposed to address the aforementioned issues by using three adaptive approaches: 1) subpopulation generation; 2) double-layer exclusion; and 3) computational resource allocation.

Furthermore, a set of TREE problems from different substations is systematically formulated into a benchmark test suite for characterizing their different properties.

In spite of many diversity preservation approaches in existing MOEAs, most of them encounter difficulties in tackling complex PFs. This article gives a detail introduction to existing diversity preservation approaches, as well as a revelation of the limitations of them. To address the limitations of existing diversity preservation approaches, this article proposes a multistage MOEA for better diversity performance. The proposed MOEA divides the optimization process into multiple stages according to the population in each generation, and updates the population by different steady-state selection schemes in different stages. According to the experimental results on 21 benchmark problems, the proposed MOEA exhibits better diversity performance than 11 existing MOEAs.},

The proposed S3-CMA-ES attempts to approximate the set of Pareto-optimal solutions using a series of small subpopulations instead of a whole population, where each subpopulation converges to only one solution. In the proposed S3-CMA-ES, a diversity improvement strategy is designed to generate and select new solutions.

The proposed test suite contains eight benchmark problems, which pose stiff challenges for existing algorithms to obtain a diverse solution set.

A fundamental process in network-based (graph-based) data analysis techniques is the network construction from original data usually in vector form. Here, a natural question is: How to construct an “optimal” network regarding a given processing goal? This paper investigates structural optimization in the context of network-based data classification tasks. To be specific, we propose a particle swarm optimization framework which is responsible for building a network from vector-based data set while optimizing a quality function driven by the classification accuracy. The classification process considers both topological and physical features of the training and test data and employing PageRank measure for classification according to the importance concept of a test instance to each class. Results on artificial and real-world problems reveal that data network generated using structural optimization provides better results in general than those generated by classical network formation methods. Moreover, this investigation suggests that other kinds of network-based machine learning and data mining tasks, such as dimensionality reduction and data clustering, can benefit from the proposed structural optimization method.},

While existing work in the literature is mainly focused on traditional dynamic optimization, little research has been dedicated to solving such IOPs. In this paper, we study how to adopt cooperative coevolution to efficiently solve a specific type of IOPs, namely, those with increasing decision variables. First, we present a benchmark function generator on the basis of some basic formulations of IOPs with increasing decision variables and exploitable modular structure. Then, we propose a contribution-based cooperative coevolutionary framework coupled with an incremental grouping method for dealing with them. On one hand, the benchmark function generator is capable of generating various benchmark functions with various characteristics. On the other hand, the proposed framework is promising in solving such problems in terms of both optimization accuracy and computational efficiency. In addition, the proposed method is further assessed using a real-world application, i.e., the design optimization of a stepped cantilever beam.},

While most existing work of multiobjectivization aims to find all optimal solutions simultaneously, in this paper, we propose to approximate multimodal fitness landscapes via multiobjectivization, thus providing an estimation of potential optimal areas. To begin with, an MMO problem is transformed into a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) by adding an adaptive diversity indicator as the second optimization objective, and an approximate fitness landscape is obtained via optimization of the transformed MOP using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Then, on the basis of the approximate fitness landscape, an adaptive peak detection method is proposed to find peaks where optimal solutions may exist. Finally, local search is performed inside the detected peaks on the approximate fitness landscape. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on 20 multimodal test functions, in comparison with three state-of-the-art algorithms for MMO. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only shows promising performance in benchmark comparisons, but also has good potential in assisting preference-based decision-making in MMO.},

	abstract = {When solving many machine learning problems such as classification, there exists a large number of input features. However, not all features are relevant for solving the problem, and sometimes, including irrelevant features may deteriorate the learning performance.Please check the edit made in the article title Therefore, it is essential to select the most relevant features, which is known as feature selection. Many feature selection algorithms have been developed, including evolutionary algorithms or particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, to find a subset of the most important features for accomplishing a particular machine learning task. However, the traditional PSO does not perform well for large-scale optimization problems, which degrades the effectiveness of PSO for feature selection when the number of features dramatically increases. In this paper, we propose to use a very recent PSO variant, known as competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) that was dedicated to large-scale optimization, for solving high-dimensional feature selection problems. In addition, the CSO, which was originally developed for continuous optimization, is adapted to perform feature selection that can be considered as a combinatorial optimization problem. An archive technique is also introduced to reduce computational cost. Experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that compared to the canonical PSO-based and a state-of-the-art PSO variant for feature selection, the proposed CSO-based feature selection algorithm not only selects a much smaller number of features, but result in better classification performance as well.},

To tackle such large-scale many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), this paper proposes a specially tailored evolutionary algorithm based on a decision variable clustering method. To begin with, the decision variable clustering method divides the decision variables into two types: 1) convergence-related variables and 2) diversity-related variables. Afterward, to optimize the two types of decision variables, a convergence optimization strategy and a diversity optimization strategy are adopted. In addition, a fast nondominated sorting approach is developed to further improve the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, empirical experiments have been conducted on a variety of large-scale MaOPs with up to ten objectives and 5000 decision variables. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages over several state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in terms of the scalability to decision variables on MaOPs.},

In this work, computational intelligence is instead used, including artificial neural networks and evolutionary computation, to enhance our understanding of nature-inspired superhydrophobic behavior. The relationships between experimental parameters (water droplet volume, weight percentage of nanoparticles used in the synthesis of the polymer composite, and distance separating the superhydrophobic surface and the pendant water droplet in adhesive force measurements) and multiple objectives (water droplet contact angle, sliding angle, and adhesive force) are built and weighted. The obtained optimal parameters are consistent with the experimental observations. This new approach to materials modeling has great potential to be applied more generally to aid design, fabrication, and optimization for myriad functional materials.},

To equip the EAs with learning abilities, recently, various model-based evolutionary algorithms (MBEAs) have been proposed. This survey briefly reviews some representative MBEAs by considering three different motivations of using models. First, the most commonly seen motivation of using models is to estimate the distribution of the candidate solutions. Second, in evolutionary multi-objective optimization, one motivation of using models is to build the inverse models from the objective space to the decision space. Third, when solving computationally expensive problems, models can be used as surrogates of the fitness functions. Based on the review, some further discussions are also given.},

Based on the analyses of the approximated Pareto front, we introduce a preference articulation method and embed it in the three evolutionary algorithms for identifying solutions that the decision-maker prefers. Our experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating user preferences into many-objective evolutionary algorithms, we are not only able to gain deep insight into the trade-off relationships between the objectives, but also to achieve high-quality solutions reflecting the decision-maker's preferences. In addition, our experimental results indicate that each of the three algorithms examined in this work has its unique advantages that can be exploited when applied to the optimization of real-world problems.},

In this paper, we carefully select (or modify) 15 test problems with diverse properties to construct a benchmark test suite, aiming to promote the research of evolutionary many-objective optimization (EMaO) via suggesting a set of test problems with a good representation of various real-world scenarios. Also, an open-source software platform with a user-friendly GUI is provided to facilitate the experimental execution and data observation.},

To address this issue, we propose an MOEA based on an enhanced inverted generational distance indicator, in which an adaptation method is suggested to adjust a set of reference points based on the indicator contributions of candidate solutions in an external archive.

However, most studies on multiobjective and many-objective optimization are limited to small-scale problems, despite the fact that many real-world multiobjective and many-objective optimization problems may involve a large number of decision variables. As has been evident in the history of evolutionary optimization, the development of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for solving a particular type of optimization problems has undergone a co-evolution with the development of test problems. To promote the research on large-scale multiobjective and many-objective optimization, we propose a set of generic test problems based on design principles widely used in the literature of multiobjective and many-objective optimization. In order for the test problems to be able to reflect challenges in real-world applications, we consider mixed separability between decision variables and nonuniform correlation between decision variables and objective functions. To assess the proposed test problems, six representative evolutionary multiobjective and many-objective EAs are tested on the proposed test problems. Our empirical results indicate that although the compared algorithms exhibit slightly different capabilities in dealing with the challenges in the test problems, none of them are able to efficiently solve these optimization problems, calling for the need for developing new EAs dedicated to large-scale multiobjective and many-objective optimization.},

In addition, it becomes increasingly important to incorporate user preferences because it will be less likely to achieve a representative subset of the Pareto-optimal solutions using a limited population size as the number of objectives increases. This paper proposes a reference vector-guided EA for many-objective optimization. The reference vectors can be used not only to decompose the original multiobjective optimization problem into a number of single-objective subproblems, but also to elucidate user preferences to target a preferred subset of the whole Pareto front (PF). In the proposed algorithm, a scalarization approach, termed angle-penalized distance, is adopted to balance convergence and diversity of the solutions in the high-dimensional objective space. An adaptation strategy is proposed to dynamically adjust the distribution of the reference vectors according to the scales of the objective functions. Our experimental results on a variety of benchmark test problems show that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive in comparison with five state-of-the-art EAs for many-objective optimization. In addition, we show that reference vectors are effective and cost-efficient for preference articulation, which is particularly desirable for many-objective optimization. Furthermore, a reference vector regeneration strategy is proposed for handling irregular PFs. Finally, the proposed algorithm is extended for solving constrained many-objective optimization problems.},

Such algorithms often require a high degree of diversity of the stored solutions and only a limited number of solutions can be achieved. By contrast, model-based algorithms can alleviate the requirement on solution diversity and in principle, as many solutions as needed can be generated. This paper proposes a new model-based method for representing and searching nondominated solutions. The main idea is to construct Gaussian process-based inverse models that map all found nondominated solutions from the objective space to the decision space. These inverse models are then used to create offspring by sampling the objective space. To facilitate inverse modeling, the multivariate inverse function is decomposed into a group of univariate functions, where the number of inverse models is reduced using a random grouping technique. Extensive empirical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits robust search performance on a variety of medium to high dimensional multiobjective optimization test problems. Additional nondominated solutions are generated a posteriori using the constructed models to increase the density of solutions in the preferred regions at a low computational cost.},

Instead, a pairwise competition mechanism is introduced, where the particle that loses the competition will update its position by learning from the winner. To understand the search behavior of the proposed CSO, a theoretical proof of convergence is provided, together with empirical analysis of its exploration and exploitation abilities showing that the proposed CSO achieves a good balance between exploration and exploitation.

In contrast to individual (asocial) learning, social learning has the advantage of allowing individuals to learn behaviors from others without incurring the costs of individual trials-and-errors. This paper introduces social learning mechanisms into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to develop a social learning PSO (SL-PSO). Unlike classical PSO variants where the particles are updated based on historical information, including the best solution found by the whole swarm (global best) and the best solution found by each particle (personal best), each particle in the proposed SL-PSO learns from any better particles (termed demonstrators) in the current swarm. In addition, to ease the burden of parameter settings, the proposed SL-PSO adopts a dimension-dependent parameter control method. The proposed SL-PSO is first compared with five representative PSO variants on 40 low-dimensional test functions, including shifted and rotated test functions. The scalability of the proposed SL-PSO is further tested by comparing it with five state-of-the-art algorithms for large-scale optimization on seven high-dimensional (100-D, 500-D, and 1000-D) benchmark functions. Our comparative results show that SL-PSO performs well on low-dimensional problems and is promising for solving large-scale problems as well.},

This technique, however, can be computationally expensive, especially when the number of individuals in the population becomes large. This is mainly because in most existing nondominated sorting algorithms, a solution needs to be compared with all other solutions before it can be assigned to a front. In this paper we propose a novel, computationally efficient approach to nondominated sorting, termed efficient nondominated sort (ENS). In ENS, a solution to be assigned to a front needs to be compared only with those that have already been assigned to a front, thereby avoiding many unnecessary dominance comparisons. Based on this new approach, two nondominated sorting algorithms have been suggested. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that the ENS-based sorting algorithms are computationally more efficient than the state-of-the-art nondominated sorting methods.},

To address this issue, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm driven by the generative adversarial networks (GANs). At each generation of the proposed algorithm, the parent solutions are first classified into real and fake samples to train the GANs; then the offspring solutions are sampled by the trained GANs. Thanks to the powerful generative ability of the GANs, our proposed algorithm is capable of generating promising offspring solutions in high-dimensional decision space with limited training data.

Among various neural architecture search (NAS) methods that are motivated to automate designs of high-performance CNNs, the differentiable NAS and population-based NAS are attracting increasing interests due to their unique characters. To benefit from the merits while overcoming the deficiencies of both, this work proposes a novel NAS method, RelativeNAS. As the key to efficient search, RelativeNAS performs joint learning between fast learners (i.e., decoded networks with relatively lower loss value) and slow learners in a pairwise manner. Moreover, since RelativeNAS only requires low-fidelity performance estimation to distinguish each pair of fast learner and slow learner, it saves certain computation costs for training the candidate architectures. The proposed RelativeNAS brings several unique advantages: 1) it achieves state-of-the-art performances on ImageNet with top-1 error rate of 24.88\%, that is, outperforming DARTS and AmoebaNet-B by 1.82\% and 1.12\%, respectively; 2) it spends only 9 h with a single 1080Ti GPU to obtain the discovered cells, that is, 3.75x and 7875x faster than DARTS and AmoebaNet, respectively; and 3) it provides that the discovered cells obtained on CIFAR-10 can be directly transferred to object detection, semantic segmentation, and keypoint detection, yielding competitive results of 73.1\% mAP on PASCAL VOC, 78.7\% mIoU on Cityscapes, and 68.5\% AP on MSCOCO, respectively.

They merely focus on handling the massive volume of decision space and ignore the complexity of LSMOPs in terms of objective functions. The complexity issue is also important since the complexity grows along with the increment in the number of decision variables. Our previous study proposed a framework to accelerate evolutionary large-scale multiobjective optimization via problem reformulation for handling large-scale decision variables. Here, we investigate the effectiveness of LSMOF combined with decomposition-based MOEA (MOEA/D), aiming to handle the complexity of LSMOPs in both the decision and objective spaces. Specifically, MOEA/D is embedded in LSMOF via two different strategies, and the proposed algorithm is tested on various benchmark LSMOPs.

The evolutionary NAS methods have achieved encouraging results due to the global search capability of evolutionary algorithms. Nevertheless, most existing evolutionary NAS methods use only the mutation operator to generate offspring architectures. Consequently, the generated architectures could be pretty different from their parent architectures, failing to inherit the modular information to accelerate the convergence rate. We propose an efficient evolutionary method using a tailored crossover operator to address this deficiency, which enables the offspring architectures to inherit from their parent architectures. Moreover, we combine it with mutation operators under the framework of the evolutionary algorithm.

	abstract = {Various works have been proposed to solve expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs) using surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) in recent decades. However, most existing methods focus on EMOPs with less than 30 decision variables, since a large number of training samples are required to build an accurate surrogate model for high-dimensional EMOPs, which is unrealistic for expensive multiobjective optimization. To address this issue, we propose an SAEA with an adaptive dropout mechanism. Specifically, this mechanism takes advantage of the statistical differences between different solution sets in the decision space to guide the selection of some crucial decision variables. A new infill criterion is then proposed to optimize the selected decision variables with the assistance of surrogate models. Moreover, the optimized decision variables are extended to new full-length solutions, and then the new candidate solutions are evaluated using expensive functions to update the archive. The proposed algorithm is tested on different benchmark problems with up to 200 decision variables compared to some state-of-the-art SAEAs. The experimental results have demonstrated the promising performance and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm in high-dimensional expensive multiobjective optimization.},

Studies have shown the importance of these strategies in improving the performance of EAs for multiobjective optimization. Our previous study proposed a specific manifold learning inspired mating restriction (MLMR) strategy. It has shown promising capability of solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) with complicated Pareto set shapes. However, the effect of mating restriction strategies in solving constrained MOPs is yet to be well studied. Here, we investigate the effectiveness of MLMR for solving constrained MOPs. The MLMR strategy is embedded into some representative multiobjective EAs and tested on various benchmark constrained MOPs. Experimental results indicate the encouraging performance of MLMR in constrained multiobjective optimization.},

Although some sexual selection schemes for GAs have been proposed, only limited studies are focused on detailed mechanisms in sexual selection. In this paper, we focus on the modeling of some significant components in sexual selection, including the concepts of male trait, female mating preference. Thereafter, a novel evolutionary framework is constructed based on these models. The theoretical principle of this framework is the famous mechanism called Fisher's runaway process. Numeric optimization is carried out to evaluate the newly proposed framework on a large number of benchmark functions used in CEC2005 Special Session. Comparing with a classic real-coded genetic algorithm, the novel framework outperforms it on most functions. Although this framework is very preliminary, it has shown good potential in solving optimization problems.},

In this work, we revisit the self-training technique for language model fine-tuning and present a state-of-the-art prompt-based few-shot learner, SFLM. Given two views of a text sample via weak and strong augmentation techniques, SFLM generates a pseudo label on the weakly augmented version. Then, the model predicts the same pseudo label when fine-tuned with the strongly augmented version. This simple approach is shown to outperform other state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised counterparts on six sentence classification and six sentence-pair classification benchmarking tasks. In addition, SFLM only relies on a few in-domain unlabeled data. We conduct a comprehensive analysis to demonstrate the robustness of our proposed approach under various settings, including augmentation techniques, model scale, and few-shot knowledge transfer across tasks.},

	abstract = {With an exponential explosive growth of various digital text information, it is challenging to efficiently obtain specific knowledge from massive unstructured text information. As one basic task for natural language processing (NLP), relation extraction (RE) aims to extract semantic relations between entity pairs based on the given text. To avoid manual labeling of datasets, distant supervision relation extraction (DSRE) has been widely used, aiming to utilize knowledge base to automatically annotate datasets. Unfortunately, this method heavily suffers from wrong labelling due to its underlying strong assumptions. To address this issue, we propose a new framework using hybrid attention-based Transformer block with multi-instance learning for DSRE. More specifically, the Transformer block is, for the first time, used as a sentence encoder, which mainly utilizes multi-head self-attention to capture syntactic information at the word level. Then, a novel sentence-level attention mechanism is proposed to calculate the bag representation, aiming to exploit all useful information in each sentence. Experimental results on the public dataset New York Times (NYT) demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms on the adopted dataset, which verifies the effectiveness of our model on the DSRE task.},

	abstract = {Learning over massive data stored in different locations is essential in many real-world applications. However, sharing data is full of challenges due to the increasing demands of privacy and security with the growing use of smart mobile devices and Internet of thing (IoT) devices. Federated learning provides a potential solution to privacy-preserving and secure machine learning, by means of jointly training a global model without uploading data distributed on multiple devices to a central server. However, most existing work on federated learning adopts machine learning models with full-precision weights, and almost all these models contain a large number of redundant parameters that do not need to be transmitted to the server, consuming an excessive amount of communication costs. To address this issue, we propose a federated trained ternary quantization (FTTQ) algorithm, which optimizes the quantized networks on the clients through a self-learning quantization factor. Theoretical proofs of the convergence of quantization factors, unbiasedness of FTTQ, as well as a reduced weight divergence are given. On the basis of FTTQ, we propose a ternary federated averaging protocol (T-FedAvg) to reduce the upstream and downstream communication of federated learning systems. Empirical experiments are conducted to train widely used deep learning models on publicly available data sets, and our results demonstrate that the proposed T-FedAvg is effective in reducing communication costs and can even achieve slightly better performance on non-IID data in contrast to the canonical federated learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {Offspring generation plays an important role in evolutionary multiobjective optimization. However, generating promising candidate solutions effectively in high-dimensional spaces is particularly challenging. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive offspring generation method for large-scale multiobjective optimization. First, a preselection strategy is proposed to select a balanced parent population, and then these parent solutions are used to construct direction vectors in the decision spaces for reproducing promising offspring solutions. Specifically, two kinds of direction vectors are adaptively used to generate offspring solutions. The first kind takes advantage of the dominated solutions to generate offspring solutions toward the Pareto optimal set (PS) for convergence enhancement, while the other kind uses those nondominated solutions to spread the solutions over the PS for diversity maintenance. The proposed offspring generation method can be embedded in many existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for large-scale multiobjective optimization. Experiments are conducted to reveal the mechanism of our proposed adaptive reproduction strategy and validate its effectiveness. Experimental results on some large-scale multiobjective optimization problems have demonstrated the competitive performance of our proposed algorithm in comparison with five state-of-the-art large-scale EAs.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07781},
	abstract = {Dense video captioning aims to generate multiple associated captions with their temporal locations from the video. Previous methods follow a sophisticated "localize-then-describe" scheme, which heavily relies on numerous hand-crafted components. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective framework for end-to-end dense video captioning with parallel decoding (PDVC), by formulating the dense caption generation as a set prediction task. In practice, through stacking a newly proposed event counter on the top of a transformer decoder, the PDVC precisely segments the video into a number of event pieces under the holistic understanding of the video content, which effectively increases the coherence and readability of predicted captions. Compared with prior arts, the PDVC has several appealing advantages: (1) Without relying on heuristic non-maximum suppression or a recurrent event sequence selection network to remove redundancy, PDVC directly produces an event set with an appropriate size; (2) In contrast to adopting the two-stage scheme, we feed the enhanced representations of event queries into the localization head and caption head in parallel, making these two sub-tasks deeply interrelated and mutually promoted through the optimization; (3) Without bells and whistles, extensive experiments on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 show that PDVC is capable of producing high-quality captioning results, surpassing the state-of-the-art two-stage methods when its localization accuracy is on par with them.

	abstract = {Recent advancements in deep neural networks have made remarkable leap-forwards in dense image prediction. However, the issue of feature alignment remains as neglected by most existing approaches for simplicity. Direct pixel addition between upsampled and local features leads to feature maps with misaligned contexts that, in turn, translate to mis-classifications in prediction, especially on object boundaries. In this paper, we propose a feature alignment module that learns transformation offsets of pixels to contextually align upsampled higher-level features; and another feature selection module to emphasize the lower-level features with rich spatial details. We then integrate these two modules in a top-down pyramidal architecture and present the Feature-aligned Pyramid Network (FaPN). Extensive experimental evaluations on four dense prediction tasks and four datasets have demonstrated the efficacy of FaPN, yielding an overall improvement of 1.2 - 2.6 points in AP / mIoU over FPN when paired with Faster / Mask R-CNN. In particular, our FaPN achieves the state-of-the-art of 56.7\% mIoU on ADE20K when integrated within Mask-Former. The code is available from https://github.com/EMI-Group/FaPN.},

abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms have played an important role
  in expensive optimization where a small number of real-objective function evaluations
  are allowed. Usually, the surrogate models are used for the same purpose, e.g.,
  to approximate the real-objective function or the aggregation fitness function.
  However, there is little work on surrogate-assisted optimization by model fusion,
  i.e., different surrogate models are fused for different purposes to improve the
  performance of the algorithm. In this work, we propose a surrogate-assisted approach
  by model fusion for solving expensive many-objective optimization problems, in which
  the Kriging assisted objective function approximation method is fused with the classifier
  assisted approach. The proposed algorithm is compared with some state-of-the-art
  surrogate-assisted algorithms on DTLZ problems and a real-world problem, and some
  encouraging results have been achieved by our proposed model fusion based approach.

abstract: In the real world, it is not uncommon to face an optimization problem with
  more than three objectives. Such problems, called many-objective optimization problems
  (MaOPs), pose great challenges to the area of evolutionary computation. The failure
  of conventional Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in dealing
  with MaOPs motivates various new approaches. However, in contrast to the rapid development
  of algorithm design, performance investigation and comparison of algorithms have
  received little attention. Several test problem suites which were designed for multi-objective
  optimization have still been dominantly used in many-objective optimization. In
  this paper, we carefully select (or modify) 15 test problems with diverse properties
  to construct a benchmark test suite, aiming to promote the research of evolutionary
  many-objective optimization (EMaO) via suggesting a set of test problems with a
  good representation of various real-world scenarios. Also, an open-source software
  platform with a user-friendly GUI is provided to facilitate the experimental execution
  and data observation.

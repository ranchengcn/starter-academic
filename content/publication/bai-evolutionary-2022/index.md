abstract: Variable grouping provides an efficient approach to large-scale optimization,
  and multipopulation strategies are effective for both large-scale optimization and
  dynamic optimization. However, variable grouping is not well studied in large-scale
  dynamic optimization when cooperating with multipopulation strategies. Specifically,
  when the numbers/sizes of the variable subcomponents are large, the performance
  of the algorithms will be substantially degraded. To address this issue, we propose
  a bilevel variable grouping (BLVG)-based framework. First, the primary grouping
  applies a state-of-the-art variable grouping method based on variable interaction
  analysis to group the variables into subcomponents. Second, the secondary grouping
  further groups the subcomponents into variable cells, that is, combination variable
  cells and decomposition variable cells. We then tailor a multipopulation strategy
  to process the two types of variable cells efficiently in a cooperative coevolutionary
  (CC) way. As indicated by the empirical study on large-scale dynamic optimization
  problems (DOPs) of up to 300 dimensions, the proposed framework outperforms several
  state-of-the-art frameworks for large-scale dynamic optimization.

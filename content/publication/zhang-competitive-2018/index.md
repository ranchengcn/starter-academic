abstract: In the past two decades, multi-objective optimization has attracted increasing
  interests in the evolutionary computation community, and a variety of multi-objective
  optimization algorithms have been proposed on the basis of different population
  based meta-heuristics, where the family of multi-objective particle swarm optimization
  is among the most representative ones. While the performance of most existing multi-objective
  particle swarm optimization algorithms largely depends on the global or personal
  best particles stored in an external archive, in this paper, we propose a competitive
  mechanism based multi-objective particle swarm optimizer, where the particles are
  updated on the basis of the pairwise competitions performed in the current swarm
  at each generation. The performance of the proposed competitive multi-objective
  particle swarm optimizer is verified by benchmark comparisons with several state-of-the-art
  multi-objective optimizers, including three multi-objective particle swarm optimization
  algorithms and three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results
  demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of both
  optimization quality and convergence speed.

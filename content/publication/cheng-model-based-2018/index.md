abstract: The evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a family of nature-inspired algorithms
  widely used for solving complex optimization problems. Since the operators (e.g.
  crossover, mutation, selection) in most traditional EAs are developed on the basis
  of fixed heuristic rules or strategies, they are unable to learn the structures
  or properties of the problems to be optimized. To equip the EAs with learning abilities,
  recently, various model-based evolutionary algorithms (MBEAs) have been proposed.
  This survey briefly reviews some representative MBEAs by considering three different
  motivations of using models. First, the most commonly seen motivation of using models
  is to estimate the distribution of the candidate solutions. Second, in evolutionary
  multi-objective optimization, one motivation of using models is to build the inverse
  models from the objective space to the decision space. Third, when solving computationally
  expensive problems, models can be used as surrogates of the fitness functions. Based
  on the review, some further discussions are also given.

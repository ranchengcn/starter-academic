abstract: The interests in multiobjective and many-objective optimization have
  been rapidly increasing in the evolutionary computation community. However,
  most studies on multiobjective and many-objective optimization are limited to
  small-scale problems, despite the fact that many real-world multiobjective and
  many-objective optimization problems may involve a large number of decision
  variables. As has been evident in the history of evolutionary optimization,
  the development of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for solving a particular type
  of optimization problems has undergone a co-evolution with the development of
  test problems. To promote the research on large-scale multiobjective and
  many-objective optimization, we propose a set of generic test problems based
  on design principles widely used in the literature of multiobjective and
  many-objective optimization. In order for the test problems to be able to
  reflect challenges in real-world applications, we consider mixed separability
  between decision variables and nonuniform correlation between decision
  variables and objective functions. To assess the proposed test problems, six
  representative evolutionary multiobjective and many-objective EAs are tested
  on the proposed test problems. Our empirical results indicate that although
  the compared algorithms exhibit slightly different capabilities in dealing
  with the challenges in the test problems, none of them are able to efficiently
  solve these optimization problems, calling for the need for developing new EAs
  dedicated to large-scale multiobjective and many-objective optimization.

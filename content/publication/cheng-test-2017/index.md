abstract: The interests in multiobjective and many-objective optimization have been
  rapidly increasing in the evolutionary computation community. However, most studies
  on multiobjective and many-objective optimization are limited to small-scale problems,
  despite the fact that many real-world multiobjective and many-objective optimization
  problems may involve a large number of decision variables. As has been evident in
  the history of evolutionary optimization, the development of evolutionary algorithms
  (EAs) for solving a particular type of optimization problems has undergone a co-evolution
  with the development of test problems. To promote the research on large-scale multiobjective
  and many-objective optimization, we propose a set of generic test problems based
  on design principles widely used in the literature of multiobjective and many-objective
  optimization. In order for the test problems to be able to reflect challenges in
  real-world applications, we consider mixed separability between decision variables
  and nonuniform correlation between decision variables and objective functions. To
  assess the proposed test problems, six representative evolutionary multiobjective
  and many-objective EAs are tested on the proposed test problems. Our empirical results
  indicate that although the compared algorithms exhibit slightly different capabilities
  in dealing with the challenges in the test problems, none of them are able to efficiently
  solve these optimization problems, calling for the need for developing new EAs dedicated
  to large-scale multiobjective and many-objective optimization.

abstract: Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) usually achieve a set of
  nondominated solutions as the approximation of the Pareto front. In order to utilize
  the solutions, a final decision making process is indispensable in most cases in
  which a small number of solutions have to be selected. In this process a decision
  maker selects the solutions according to his or her preferences or based on the
  knowledge acquired by observing the approximated Pareto front. Due to the limited
  number of solutions an algorithm can obtain, in particular when the number of objectives
  is large, a decision maker may be interested in sampling additional solutions in
  some preferred regions. This paper proposes to use a reference vector based preference
  articulation (RVPA) method to obtain such additional solutions in preferred regions.
  After describing the proposed method in detail, experiments are conducted on six
  benchmark MOPs to assess the performance of the proposed RVPA method. Our empirical
  results show that, by setting reference vectors in the objective space, the proposed
  RVPA is able to obtain corresponding solutions in the preferred regions at a much
  lower cost compared to e.g. a re-start strategy. In addition, by setting the reference
  vectors in a uniform way, the proposed RVPA method is also able to improve the general
  quality (convergence and distribution) of the solutions obtained by an MOEA.

abstract: Many real-world optimization problems are dynamic. The field of dynamic
  optimization deals with such problems where the search space changes over time.
  In this two-part article, we present a comprehensive survey of the research in evolutionary
  dynamic optimization for single-objective unconstrained continuous problems over
  the last two decades. In Part A of this survey, we propose a new taxonomy for the
  components of dynamic optimization algorithms (DOAs), namely, convergence detection,
  change detection, explicit archiving, diversity control, and population division
  and management. In comparison to the existing taxonomies, the proposed taxonomy
  covers some additional important components, such as convergence detection and computational
  resource allocation. Moreover, we significantly expand and improve the classifications
  of diversity control and multipopulation methods, which are underrepresented in
  the existing taxonomies. We then provide detailed technical descriptions and analysis
  of different components according to the suggested taxonomy. Part B of this survey
  provides an in-depth analysis of the most commonly used benchmark problems, performance
  analysis methods, static optimization algorithms used as the optimization components
  in the DOAs, and dynamic real-world applications. Finally, several opportunities
  for future work are pointed out.

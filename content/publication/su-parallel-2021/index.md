abstract: Community detection in large-scale complex networks has recently received
  significant attention as the volume of available data is becoming larger. The use
  of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for community detection in large-scale networks
  has gained considerable popularity because these algorithms are fairly effective
  in networks with a relatively small number of nodes. In this paper, we propose a
  parallel multi-objective EA, called PMOEA, for community detection in large-scale
  networks, where the communities associated with key network nodes are detected in
  parallel. Specifically, we develop a multi-objective and a single-objective EA.
  The former is used to detect the communities of a key node instead of all communities
  in the network. The latter obtains the communities in the entire network using the
  previously detected communities of each key node. The performance of the proposed
  method was verified on both large-scale synthetic benchmark networks and real-world
  networks. The results demonstrated the superiority of PMOEA over six EA-based and
  two non-EA-based community-detection algorithms for large-scale networks.

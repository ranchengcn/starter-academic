abstract: Dynamic changes are an important and inescapable aspect of many real-world
  optimization problems. Designing algorithms to find and track desirable solutions
  while facing challenges of dynamic optimization problems is an active research topic
  in the field of swarm and evolutionary computation. To evaluate and compare the
  performance of algorithms, it is imperative to use a suitable benchmark that generates
  problem instances with different controllable characteristics. In this article,
  we give a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks and investigate their shortcomings
  in capturing different problem features. We then propose a highly configurable benchmark
  suite, the generalized moving peaks benchmark, capable of generating problem instances
  whose components have a variety of properties, such as different levels of ill-conditioning,
  variable interactions, shape, and complexity. Moreover, components generated by
  the proposed benchmark can be highly dynamic with respect to the gradients, heights,
  optimum locations, condition numbers, shapes, complexities, and variable interactions.
  Finally, several well-known optimizers and dynamic optimization algorithms are chosen
  to solve generated problems by the proposed benchmark. The experimental results
  show the poor performance of the existing methods in facing new challenges posed
  by the addition of new properties.

abstract: Most optimization algorithms suppose that there exist explicit evaluation
  functions to evaluate the candidate solutions obtained during the optimization process.
  However, in actual industrial processes, it is usually very difficult to build up
  precise mathematical models to describe complex industrial processes due to the
  lack of clear mechanisms. Instead, only some noisy historical data can be used,
  and optimization of such problem is often known as data-driven optimization. The
  optimization of complex beneficiation operational process is a typical data-driven
  optimization problem. To solve this problem, an evolutionary algorithm assisted
  by Gaussian process model is proposed in this paper. To be specific, a low-order
  neural network model is constructed by using the data collected from mineral processing
  factory as real objective function, and a Gaussian process model is developed as
  a surrogate to reduce the number of real function evaluations. We test the new method
  on a series of multi-objective test instances against two other algorithms. The
  experimental results indicate that the proposed method has the ability to achieve
  significant improvement at the limited budget of real function evaluations. In addition,
  the proposed algorithm is also successfully applied to the optimization of complex
  beneficiation operational process.

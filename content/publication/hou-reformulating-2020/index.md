abstract: Despite that the reference point based preference articulation plays a vital
  role in evolutionary multi- and many-objective optimization, three issues remain
  challenging. First, the performance of reference point based preference articulation
  largely depends on the location of the reference point. Second, the parameter settings
  for controlling the region of interest are not robust to the Pareto optimal fronts
  with different complicated shapes. Third, most existing methods have poor scalability
  to the number of objectives. To meet these challenges, we propose to reformulate
  preferences into constraints for evolutionary multi- and many-objective optimization.
  Extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark problems are conducted to demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our proposed method.

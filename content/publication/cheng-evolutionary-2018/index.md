abstract: Recently, by taking advantage of evolutionary multiobjective optimization
  techniques in diversity preservation, the means of multiobjectivization has attracted
  increasing interest in the studies of multimodal optimization (MMO). While most
  existing work of multiobjectivization aims to find all optimal solutions simultaneously,
  in this paper, we propose to approximate multimodal fitness landscapes via multiobjectivization,
  thus providing an estimation of potential optimal areas. To begin with, an MMO problem
  is transformed into a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) by adding an adaptive
  diversity indicator as the second optimization objective, and an approximate fitness
  landscape is obtained via optimization of the transformed MOP using a multiobjective
  evolutionary algorithm. Then, on the basis of the approximate fitness landscape,
  an adaptive peak detection method is proposed to find peaks where optimal solutions
  may exist. Finally, local search is performed inside the detected peaks on the approximate
  fitness landscape. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive
  experiments are conducted on 20 multimodal test functions, in comparison with three
  state-of-the-art algorithms for MMO. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
  algorithm not only shows promising performance in benchmark comparisons, but also
  has good potential in assisting preference-based decision-making in MMO.

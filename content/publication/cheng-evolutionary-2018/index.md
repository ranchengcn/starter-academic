abstract: Recently, by taking advantage of evolutionary multiobjective
  optimization techniques in diversity preservation, the means of
  multiobjectivization has attracted increasing interest in the studies of
  multimodal optimization (MMO). While most existing work of
  multiobjectivization aims to find all optimal solutions simultaneously, in
  this paper, we propose to approximate multimodal fitness landscapes via
  multiobjectivization, thus providing an estimation of potential optimal areas.
  To begin with, an MMO problem is transformed into a multiobjective
  optimization problem (MOP) by adding an adaptive diversity indicator as the
  second optimization objective, and an approximate fitness landscape is
  obtained via optimization of the transformed MOP using a multiobjective
  evolutionary algorithm. Then, on the basis of the approximate fitness
  landscape, an adaptive peak detection method is proposed to find peaks where
  optimal solutions may exist. Finally, local search is performed inside the
  detected peaks on the approximate fitness landscape. To assess the performance
  of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on 20
  multimodal test functions, in comparison with three state-of-the-art
  algorithms for MMO. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
  algorithm not only shows promising performance in benchmark comparisons, but
  also has good potential in assisting preference-based decision-making in MMO.

abstract: Visualizing a high-dimensional solution set over the evolution process is
  a viable way to investigate the search behavior of evolutionary multi-objective
  optimization. The parallel coordinates plot which scales well to the data dimensionality
  is frequently used to observe solution sets in multi-objective optimization. However,
  the solution sets in parallel coordinates are typically presented by the natural
  order of the optimized objectives, with rare information of the relation between
  these objectives and also the Pareto dominance relation between solutions. In this
  paper, we attempt to adjust parallel coordinates to incorporate this information.
  Systematic experiments have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.

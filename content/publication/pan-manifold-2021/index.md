abstract: Under certain smoothness assumptions, the Pareto set of a continuous multiobjective
  optimization problem is a piecewise continuous manifold in the decision space, which
  can be derived from the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition. Despite that a number of multiobjective
  evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed, their performance on multiobjective
  optimization problems with complicated Pareto sets (MOP-cPS) is still unsatisfying.
  In this article, we adopt the concept of manifold and propose a manifold learning-inspired
  mating strategy to enhance the diversity maintenance in MOEAs for solving MOP-cPS
  efficiently. In the proposed strategy, all of the individuals are first clustered
  into different manifolds according to their distribution in the objective space,
  and then the mating reproduction is restricted among individuals in the same manifold.
  Moreover, we embed the proposed mating strategy in three representative MOEAs and
  compare the embedded MOEAs with their original versions using the assortative genetic
  operators on a variety of MOP-cPS. The experimental results demonstrate the significant
  performance improvements benefitting from the proposed mating restriction strategy.

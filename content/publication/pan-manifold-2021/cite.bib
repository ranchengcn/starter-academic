 abstract = {Under certain smoothness assumptions, the Pareto set of a continuous multiobjective optimization problem is a piecewise continuous manifold in the decision space, which can be derived from the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition. Despite that a number of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed, their performance on multiobjective optimization problems with complicated Pareto sets (MOP-cPS) is still unsatisfying. In this article, we adopt the concept of manifold and propose a manifold learning-inspired mating strategy to enhance the diversity maintenance in MOEAs for solving MOP-cPS efficiently. In the proposed strategy, all of the individuals are first clustered into different manifolds according to their distribution in the objective space, and then the mating reproduction is restricted among individuals in the same manifold. Moreover, we embed the proposed mating strategy in three representative MOEAs and compare the embedded MOEAs with their original versions using the assortative genetic operators on a variety of MOP-cPS. The experimental results demonstrate the significant performance improvements benefitting from the proposed mating restriction strategy.},

abstract: Large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) are emerging and
  widely existed in real-world applications, which involve a large number of decision
  variables and multiple conflicting objectives. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are
  naturally suitable for multiobjective optimization due to their population-based
  property, allowing the search of optima simultaneously. Nevertheless, LSMOPs are
  challenging for conventional EAs, mainly due to the huge volume of search space
  in LSMOPs. Thus, it is important to explore the impact of the population sizing
  on the performance of conventional multiobjective EAs (MOEAs) in solving LSMOPs.
  In this work, we compare several representative MOEAs with different settings of
  population sizes on some transformer ratio error estimation (TREE) problems in the
  power system. These test cases are defined on combinations of three population sizes,
  three TREE problems, and five MOEAs. Our results indicate that the performances
  of conventional MOEAs with different population sizes in solving LSMOPs are different.
  The impact of population sizing is most significant for differential evolution based
  and particle swarm based MOEAs.

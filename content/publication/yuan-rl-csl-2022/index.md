abstract: Reinforcement learning-based methods have shown great potential in solving
  combinatorial optimization problems. However, the related research has not been
  mature in terms of both models and training methods. This paper proposes a method
  based on reinforcement learning and contrastive self-supervised learning. To be
  specific, the proposed method uses an attention model to learn a policy for generating
  solutions and combines a contrastive self-supervised learning model to learn the
  attention encoder in the way of node-by-node. Correspondingly, a two-phase learning
  method, including node-wise learning and solution-wise learning, is adopted to train
  the attention model and the contrastive self-supervised model jointly and collaboratively.
  The performance of the proposed method has been verified by numerical experiments
  on various combinatorial optimization problems.

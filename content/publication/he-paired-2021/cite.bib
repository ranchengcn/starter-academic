 abstract = {Constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) widely exist in real-world applications, and they are challenging for conventional evolutionary algorithms (EAs) due to the existence of multiple constraints and objectives. When the number of objectives or decision variables is scaled up in CMOPs, the performance of EAs may degenerate dramatically and may fail to obtain any feasible solutions. To address this issue, we propose a paired offspring generation-based multiobjective EA for constrained large-scale optimization. The general idea is to emphasize the role of offspring generation in reproducing some promising feasible or useful infeasible offspring solutions. We first adopt a small set of reference vectors for constructing several subpopulations with a fixed number of neighborhood solutions. Then, a pairing strategy is adopted to determine some pairwise parent solutions for offspring generation. Consequently, the pairwise parent solutions, which could be infeasible, may guide the generation of well-converged solutions to cross the infeasible region(s) effectively. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on CMOPs with up to 1000 decision variables and ten objectives. Moreover, each component in the proposed algorithm is examined in terms of its effect on the overall algorithmic performance. Experimental results on a variety of existing and our tailored test problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in constrained large-scale multiobjective optimization.},

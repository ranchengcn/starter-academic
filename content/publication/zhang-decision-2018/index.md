abstract: 'The current literature of evolutionary many-objective optimization is merely
  focused on the scalability to the number of objectives, while little work has considered
  the scalability to the number of decision variables. Nevertheless, many real-world
  problems can involve both many objectives and large-scale decision variables. To
  tackle such large-scale many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), this paper
  proposes a specially tailored evolutionary algorithm based on a decision variable
  clustering method. To begin with, the decision variable clustering method divides
  the decision variables into two types: 1) convergence-related variables and 2) diversity-related
  variables. Afterward, to optimize the two types of decision variables, a convergence
  optimization strategy and a diversity optimization strategy are adopted. In addition,
  a fast nondominated sorting approach is developed to further improve the computational
  efficiency of the proposed algorithm. To assess the performance of the proposed
  algorithm, empirical experiments have been conducted on a variety of large-scale
  MaOPs with up to ten objectives and 5000 decision variables. Our experimental results
  demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages over several
  state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in terms of the scalability to decision
  variables on MaOPs.'

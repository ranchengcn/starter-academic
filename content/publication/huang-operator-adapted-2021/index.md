abstract: Large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) exist widely in
  real-world applications, and they are challenging for existing evolutionary algorithms
  due to their massive volume of search space. Despite that a number of large-scale
  multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (LSMOEAs) have been proposed in recent years,
  their effectiveness in solving LSMOPs remains unsatisfactory. One main reason is
  that most existing LSMOEAs may fail to balance convergence enhancement and diversity
  maintenance, especially for solving real-world problems. To address this issue,
  we propose to use a hybridized LSMOEA with adaptive operator selection (AOS) to
  handle real-world LSMOPs. Specifically, the proposed hybridized LSMOEA with AOS
  (AOS-LSMOEA) includes multiple different offspring generation and environmental
  selection strategies extracted from some existing LSMOEAs. Then it uses the AOS
  to adaptively determine the application rates of different offspring generation
  and environmental selection operators in an online manner. The proposed approach
  is capable of taking advantage of existing LSMOEAs, and the AOS enables the algorithm
  to choose suitable operators for solving different LSMOPs. In this study, the proposed
  algorithm is expected to solve the voltage transformer ratio error estimation (TREE)
  problems effectively. Experimental results show that AOS-LSMOEA achieves significant
  performance improvement due to the hybridization of different operators and the
  adoption of AOS method.

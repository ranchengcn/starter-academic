abstract: >
  Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have shown promising
  performance in solving various optimization problems, but their performance
  may deteriorate drastically when tackling problems containing a large number
  of decision variables. In recent years, a large amount of efforts have been
  devoted to addressing the challenges brought by large-scale multi-objective
  optimization problems (LSMOPs). This article presents a comprehensive survey
  of stat-of-the-art MOEAs for solving LSMOPs. We start with a categorization of
  these MOEAs into decision variable grouping based, decision space reduction
  based, and novel search strategy based MOEAs, discussing their strengths and
  weaknesses. Then, we review the benchmark problems for performance assessment
  and a few important and emerging applications of MOEAs for large-scale
  multi-objective optimization. Lastly, we discuss some remaining challenges and
  future research directions of evolutionary large-scale multi-objective
  optimization.

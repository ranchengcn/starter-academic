abstract: Due to acromegalyâ€™s insidious onset and slow progression, its diagnosis
  is usually delayed, thus causing severe complications and treatment difficulty.
  A convenient screening method is imperative. Based on our previous work, we herein
  developed a new automatic diagnosis and severity-classification model for acromegaly
  using facial photographs by deep learning on the data of 2148 photographs at different
  severity levels. Each photograph was given a score reflecting its severity (range
  1textasciitilde3). Our developed model achieved a prediction accuracy of 90.7% on
  the internal test dataset and outperformed the performance of ten junior internal
  medicine physicians (89.0%). The prospect of applying this model to real clinical
  practices is promising due to its potential health economic benefits.

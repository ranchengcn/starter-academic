 abstract = {Due to acromegaly’s insidious onset and slow progression, its diagnosis is usually delayed, thus causing severe complications and treatment difficulty. A convenient screening method is imperative. Based on our previous work, we herein developed a new automatic diagnosis and severity-classification model for acromegaly using facial photographs by deep learning on the data of 2148 photographs at different severity levels. Each photograph was given a score reflecting its severity (range 1~3). Our developed model achieved a prediction accuracy of 90.7% on the internal test dataset and outperformed the performance of ten junior internal medicine physicians (89.0%). The prospect of applying this model to real clinical practices is promising due to its potential health economic benefits.},

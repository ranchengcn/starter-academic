abstract: Diversity preservation is a crucial technique in multiobjective evolutionary
  algorithms (MOEAs), which aims at evolving the population toward the Pareto front
  (PF) with a uniform distribution and a good extensity. In spite of many diversity
  preservation approaches in existing MOEAs, most of them encounter difficulties in
  tackling complex PFs. This article gives a detail introduction to existing diversity
  preservation approaches, as well as a revelation of the limitations of them. To
  address the limitations of existing diversity preservation approaches, this article
  proposes a multistage MOEA for better diversity performance. The proposed MOEA divides
  the optimization process into multiple stages according to the population in each
  generation, and updates the population by different steady-state selection schemes
  in different stages. According to the experimental results on 21 benchmark problems,
  the proposed MOEA exhibits better diversity performance than 11 existing MOEAs.

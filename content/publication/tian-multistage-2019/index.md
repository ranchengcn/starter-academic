abstract: Diversity preservation is a crucial technique in multiobjective
  evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), which aims at evolving the population toward
  the Pareto front (PF) with a uniform distribution and a good extensity. In
  spite of many diversity preservation approaches in existing MOEAs, most of
  them encounter difficulties in tackling complex PFs. This article gives a
  detail introduction to existing diversity preservation approaches, as well as
  a revelation of the limitations of them. To address the limitations of
  existing diversity preservation approaches, this article proposes a multistage
  MOEA for better diversity performance. The proposed MOEA divides the
  optimization process into multiple stages according to the population in each
  generation, and updates the population by different steady-state selection
  schemes in different stages. According to the experimental results on 21
  benchmark problems, the proposed MOEA exhibits better diversity performance
  than 11 existing MOEAs.

abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have shown promising performance
  in solving various optimization problems, but their performance may deteriorate
  drastically when tackling problems containing a large number of decision variables.
  In recent years, much effort been devoted to addressing the challenges brought by
  large-scale multi-objective optimization problems. This article presents a comprehensive
  survey of stat-of-the-art MOEAs for solving large-scale multi-objective optimization
  problems. We start with a categorization of these MOEAs into decision variable grouping
  based, decision space reduction based, and novel search strategy based MOEAs, discussing
  their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we review the benchmark problems for performance
  assessment and a few important and emerging applications of MOEAs for large-scale
  multi-objective optimization. Last, we discuss some remaining challenges and future
  research directions of evolutionary large-scale multi-objective optimization.

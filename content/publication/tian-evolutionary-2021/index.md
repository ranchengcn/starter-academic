abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have shown promising performance
  in solving various optimization problems, but their performance may deteriorate
  drastically when tackling problems containing a large number of decision variables.
  In recent years, a large amount of efforts have been devoted to addressing the challenges
  brought by large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs). This article
  presents a comprehensive survey of stat-of-the-art MOEAs for solving LSMOPs. We
  start with a categorization of these MOEAs into decision variable grouping based,
  decision space reduction based, and novel search strategy based MOEAs, discussing
  their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we review the benchmark problems for performance
  assessment and a few important and emerging applications of MOEAs for large-scale
  multi-objective optimization. Lastly, we discuss some remaining challenges and future
  research directions of evolutionary large-scale multi-objective optimization.

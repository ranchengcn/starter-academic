abstract: Mating restriction strategies are capable of restricting the distribution
  of parent solutions for effective offspring generation in evolutionary algorithms
  (EAs). Studies have shown the importance of these strategies in improving the performance
  of EAs for multiobjective optimization. Our previous study proposed a specific manifold
  learning inspired mating restriction (MLMR) strategy. It has shown promising capability
  of solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) with complicated Pareto set
  shapes. However, the effect of mating restriction strategies in solving constrained
  MOPs is yet to be well studied. Here, we investigate the effectiveness of MLMR for
  solving constrained MOPs. The MLMR strategy is embedded into some representative
  multiobjective EAs and tested on various benchmark constrained MOPs. Experimental
  results indicate the encouraging performance of MLMR in constrained multiobjective
  optimization.

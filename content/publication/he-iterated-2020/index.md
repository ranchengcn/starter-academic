abstract: Due to the curse of dimensionality, two main issues remain challenging for
  applying evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to large-scale multiobjective optimization.
  The first issue is how to improve the efficiency of EAs for reducing computation
  cost. The second one is how to improve the diversity maintenance of EAs to avoid
  local optima. Nevertheless, these two issues are somehow conflicting with each other,
  and thus it is crucial to strike a balance between them in practice. Thereby, we
  propose an iterated problem reformulation based EA for large-scale multiobjective
  optimization, where the problem reformulation based method and the decomposition
  based method are used iteratively to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed
  method is compared with several state-of-the-art EAs on a variety of large-scale
  multiobjective optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our proposed iterated method in large-scale multiobjective optimization.

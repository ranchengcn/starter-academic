 abstract = {Due to the curse of dimensionality, two main issues remain challenging for applying evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to large-scale multiobjective optimization. The first issue is how to improve the efficiency of EAs for reducing computation cost. The second one is how to improve the diversity maintenance of EAs to avoid local optima. Nevertheless, these two issues are somehow conflicting with each other, and thus it is crucial to strike a balance between them in practice. Thereby, we propose an iterated problem reformulation based EA for large-scale multiobjective optimization, where the problem reformulation based method and the decomposition based method are used iteratively to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art EAs on a variety of large-scale multiobjective optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed iterated method in large-scale multiobjective optimization.},

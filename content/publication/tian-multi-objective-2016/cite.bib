 abstract = {As a pivotal component in multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), the environmental selection determines the quality of candidate solutions to survive at each generation. In practice, different environmental selection strategies can be based on different selection criteria, where the performance metrics (or indicators) are shown to be among the most effective ones. This paper proposes an MOEA whose environmental selection is based on an enhanced inverted generational distance metric that is able to detect noncontributing solutions (termed IGD-NS), thereby considerably accelerating the convergence of the evolutionary search. Experimental results on ZDT and DTLZ test suites demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed MOEA/IGD-NS in comparison with some representative MOEAs.},

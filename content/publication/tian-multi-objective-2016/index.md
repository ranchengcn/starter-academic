abstract: As a pivotal component in multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs),
  the environmental selection determines the quality of candidate solutions to survive
  at each generation. In practice, different environmental selection strategies can
  be based on different selection criteria, where the performance metrics (or indicators)
  are shown to be among the most effective ones. This paper proposes an MOEA whose
  environmental selection is based on an enhanced inverted generational distance metric
  that is able to detect noncontributing solutions (termed IGD-NS), thereby considerably
  accelerating the convergence of the evolutionary search. Experimental results on
  ZDT and DTLZ test suites demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed
  MOEA/IGD-NS in comparison with some representative MOEAs.

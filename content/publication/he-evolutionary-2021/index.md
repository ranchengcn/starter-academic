abstract: Recently, increasing works have been proposed to drive evolutionary algorithms
  using machine-learning models. Usually, the performance of such model-based evolutionary
  algorithms is highly dependent on the training qualities of the adopted models.
  Since it usually requires a certain amount of data (i.e., the candidate solutions
  generated by the algorithms) for model training, the performance deteriorates rapidly
  with the increase of the problem scales due to the curse of dimensionality. To address
  this issue, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm driven by the generative
  adversarial networks (GANs). At each generation of the proposed algorithm, the parent
  solutions are first classified into real and fake samples to train the GANs; then
  the offspring solutions are sampled by the trained GANs. Thanks to the powerful
  generative ability of the GANs, our proposed algorithm is capable of generating
  promising offspring solutions in high-dimensional decision space with limited training
  data. The proposed algorithm is tested on ten benchmark problems with up to 200
  decision variables. The experimental results on these test problems demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

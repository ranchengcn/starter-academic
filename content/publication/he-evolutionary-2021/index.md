abstract: Recently, increasing works have been proposed to drive evolutionary
  algorithms using machine-learning models. Usually, the performance of such
  model-based evolutionary algorithms is highly dependent on the training
  qualities of the adopted models. Since it usually requires a certain amount of
  data (i.e., the candidate solutions generated by the algorithms) for model
  training, the performance deteriorates rapidly with the increase of the
  problem scales due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we
  propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm driven by the generative
  adversarial networks (GANs). At each generation of the proposed algorithm, the
  parent solutions are first classified into real and fake samples to train the
  GANs; then the offspring solutions are sampled by the trained GANs. Thanks to
  the powerful generative ability of the GANs, our proposed algorithm is capable
  of generating promising offspring solutions in high-dimensional decision space
  with limited training data. The proposed algorithm is tested on ten benchmark
  problems with up to 200 decision variables. The experimental results on these
  test problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

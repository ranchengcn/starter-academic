abstract: Surrogate models have shown to be effective in assisting metaheuristic algorithms
  for solving computationally expensive complex optimization problems. The effectiveness
  of existing surrogate-assisted metaheuristic algorithms, however, has only been
  verified on low-dimensional optimization problems. In this paper, a surrogate-assisted
  cooperative swarm optimization algorithm is proposed, in which a surrogate-assisted
  particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and a surrogate-assisted social learning-based
  PSO (SL-PSO) algorithm cooperatively search for the global optimum. The cooperation
  between the PSO and the SL-PSO consists of two aspects. First, they share promising
  solutions evaluated by the real fitness function. Second, the SL-PSO focuses on
  exploration while the PSO concentrates on local search. Empirical studies on six
  50-D and six 100-D benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is
  able to find high-quality solutions for high-dimensional problems on a limited computational
  budget.

abstract: During the past two decades, a variety of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms
  (MOEAs) have been proposed in the literature. As pointed out in some recent studies,
  however, the performance of an MOEA can strongly depend on the Pareto front shape
  of the problem to be solved, whereas most existing MOEAs show poor versatility on
  problems with different shapes of Pareto fronts. To address this issue, we propose
  an MOEA based on an enhanced inverted generational distance indicator, in which
  an adaptation method is suggested to adjust a set of reference points based on the
  indicator contributions of candidate solutions in an external archive. Our experimental
  results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is versatile for solving problems
  with various types of Pareto fronts, outperforming several state-of-the-art evolutionary
  algorithms for multiobjective and many-objective optimization.

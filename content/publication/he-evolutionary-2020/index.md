abstract: Ratio error (RE) estimation of the voltage transformers (VTs) plays an important
  role in modern power delivery systems. Existing RE estimation methods mainly focus
  on periodical calibration but ignore the time-varying property. Consequently, it
  is difficult to efficiently estimate the state of the VTs in real time. To address
  this issue, we formulate a time-varying RE estimation (TREE) problem into a large-scale
  multiobjective optimization problem, where the multiple objectives and inequality
  constraints are formulated by statistical and physical rules extracted from the
  power delivery systems. Furthermore, a set of TREE problems from different substations
  is systematically formulated into a benchmark test suite for characterizing their
  different properties. The formulation of these TREE problems not only transfers
  an expensive RE estimation task to a relatively cheaper optimization problem but
  also promotes the research in large-scale multiobjective optimization by providing
  a real-world benchmark test suite with complex variable interactions and correlations
  to different objectives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to
  formulate a real-world problem into a benchmark test suite for large-scale multiobjective
  optimization, and it is also the first work proposing to solve TREE problems via
  evolutionary multiobjective optimization.

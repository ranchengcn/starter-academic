abstract: 'Complex networks provide a powerful tool for data representation due to
  its ability to describe the interplay between topological, functional, and dynamical
  properties of the input data. A fundamental process in network-based (graph-based)
  data analysis techniques is the network construction from original data usually
  in vector form. Here, a natural question is: How to construct an “optimal” network
  regarding a given processing goal? This paper investigates structural optimization
  in the context of network-based data classification tasks. To be specific, we propose
  a particle swarm optimization framework which is responsible for building a network
  from vector-based data set while optimizing a quality function driven by the classification
  accuracy. The classification process considers both topological and physical features
  of the training and test data and employing PageRank measure for classification
  according to the importance concept of a test instance to each class. Results on
  artificial and real-world problems reveal that data network generated using structural
  optimization provides better results in general than those generated by classical
  network formation methods. Moreover, this investigation suggests that other kinds
  of network-based machine learning and data mining tasks, such as dimensionality
  reduction and data clustering, can benefit from the proposed structural optimization
  method.'

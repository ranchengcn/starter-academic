abstract: 'Graph-based dimensionality reduction has attracted a lot of attention in
  recent years. Such methods aim to exploit the graph representation in order to catch
  some structural information hidden in data. They usually consist of two steps: graph
  construction and projection. Although graph construction is crucial to the performance,
  most research work in the literature has focused on the development of heuristics
  and models to the projection step, and only very recently, attention was paid to
  network construction. In this work, graph construction is considered in the context
  of supervised dimensionality reduction. To be specific, using a nature-inspired
  optimization framework, this work investigates if an optimized graph is able to
  provide better projections than well-known general-purpose methods. The proposed
  method is compared with widely used graph construction methods on a range of real-world
  image classification problems. Results show that the optimization framework has
  achieved considerable dimensionality reduction rates as well as good predictive
  performance.'

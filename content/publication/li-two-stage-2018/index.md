abstract: R2 indicator based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (R2-MOEAs) have
  achieved promising performance on traditional multi-objective optimization problems
  (MOPs) with two and three objectives, but still cannot well handle many-objective
  optimization problems (MaOPs) with more than three objectives. To address this issue,
  this paper proposes a two-stage R2 indicator based evolutionary algorithm (TS-R2EA)
  for many-objective optimization. In the proposed TS-R2EA, we first adopt an R2 indicator
  based achievement scalarizing function for the primary selection. In addition, by
  taking advantage of the reference vector guided objective space partition approach
  in diversity management for many-objective optimization, the secondary selection
  strategy is further applied. Such a two-stage selection strategy is expected to
  achieve a balance between convergence and diversity. Extensive experiments are conducted
  on a variety of benchmark test problems, and the experimental results demonstrate
  that the proposed algorithm has competitive performance in comparison with several
  tailored algorithms for many-objective optimization.

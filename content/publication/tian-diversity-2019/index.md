abstract: Diversity preservation plays an important role in the design of multi-objective
  evolutionary algorithms, but the diversity performance assessment of these algorithms
  remains challenging. To address this issue, this paper proposes a performance metric
  and a multi-objective test suite for the diversity assessment of multiobjective
  evolutionary algorithms. The proposed metric assesses both the evenness and spread
  of a solution set by projecting it to a lower-dimensional hypercube and calculating
  the \"volume\" of the projected solution set. The proposed test suite contains eight
  benchmark problems, which pose stiff challenges for existing algorithms to obtain
  a diverse solution set. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed metric
  can assess the diversity of a solution set more precisely than existing ones, and
  the proposed test suite can be used to effectively distinguish between algorithms
  with respect to their diversity performance.

abstract: A business delivery model with professional vehicles as well as occasional
  passing-by vehicles is investigated in this paper. The drivers deliver parcels from
  the distribution center to customers and the passing-by driver can get a certain
  amount of compensation in return. To give a satisfactory solution from the perspective
  of platform owner, customers, professional drivers, occasional drivers, and authority,
  a multi-layer comprehensive model is proposed. To effectively solve the proposed
  model, we introduce an improved variable neighborhood search (VNS) with a memory-based
  restart mechanism. The new algorithm is evaluated on instances derived from Solomonâ€™s
  benchmark and real-life beer delivery instances. Taguchi experiment is used to tune
  parameters in the proposed VNS, followed by component analysis and real-life experiments.
  Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategies are effective and the
  new delivery model in this paper has some advantages over traditional and single-delivery
  ones from the comprehensive perspectives of stakeholders in the crowdsourcing logistics
  system.

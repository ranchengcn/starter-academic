abstract: The effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms have been verified on multi-objective
  optimization, and a large number of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have
  been proposed during the last two decades. To quantitatively compare the performance
  of different algorithms, a set of uniformly distributed reference points sampled
  on the Pareto fronts of benchmark problems are needed in the calculation of many
  performance metrics. However, not much work has been done to investigate the method
  for sampling reference points on Pareto fronts, even though it is not an easy task
  for many Pareto fronts with irregular shapes. More recently, an evolutionary multi-objective
  optimization platform was proposed by us, called PlatEMO, which can automatically
  generate reference points on each Pareto front and use them to calculate the performance
  metric values. In this paper, we report the reference point sampling methods used
  in PlatEMO for different types of Pareto fronts. Experimental results show that
  the reference points generated by the proposed sampling methods can evaluate the
  performance of algorithms more accurately than randomly sampled reference points.

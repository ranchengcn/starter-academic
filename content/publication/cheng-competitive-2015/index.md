abstract: In this paper, a novel competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) for large
  scale optimization is proposed. The algorithm is fundamentally inspired by the
  particle swarm optimization but is conceptually very different. In the
  proposed CSO, neither the personal best position of each particle nor the
  global best position (or neighborhood best positions) is involved in updating
  the particles. Instead, a pairwise competition mechanism is introduced, where
  the particle that loses the competition will update its position by learning
  from the winner. To understand the search behavior of the proposed CSO, a
  theoretical proof of convergence is provided, together with empirical analysis
  of its exploration and exploitation abilities showing that the proposed CSO
  achieves a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Despite its
  algorithmic simplicity, our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
  CSO exhibits a better overall performance than five state-of-the-art
  metaheuristic algorithms on a set of widely used large scale optimization
  problems and is able to effectively solve problems of dimensionality up to
  5000.

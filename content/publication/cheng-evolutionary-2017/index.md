abstract: Many real-world optimization problems have more than three objectives, which
  has triggered increasing research interest in developing efficient and effective
  evolutionary algorithms for solving many-objective optimization problems. However,
  most many-objective evolutionary algorithms have only been evaluated on benchmark
  test functions and few applied to real-world optimization problems. To move a step
  forward, this paper presents a case study of solving a many-objective hybrid electric
  vehicle controller design problem using three state-of-the-art algorithms, namely,
  a decomposition based evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D), a non-dominated sorting based
  genetic algorithm (NSGA-III), and a reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm
  (RVEA). We start with atypical setting aimed at approximating the Pareto front without
  introducing any user preferences. Based on the analyses of the approximated Pareto
  front, we introduce a preference articulation method and embed it in the three evolutionary
  algorithms for identifying solutions that the decision-maker prefers. Our experimental
  results demonstrate that by incorporating user preferences into many-objective evolutionary
  algorithms, we are not only able to gain deep insight into the trade-off relationships
  between the objectives, but also to achieve high-quality solutions reflecting the
  decision-maker's preferences. In addition, our experimental results indicate that
  each of the three algorithms examined in this work has its unique advantages that
  can be exploited when applied to the optimization of real-world problems.

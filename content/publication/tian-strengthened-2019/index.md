abstract: Both convergence and diversity are crucial to evolutionary many-objective
  optimization, whereas most existing dominance relations show poor performance in
  balancing them, thus easily leading to a set of solutions concentrating on a small
  region of the Pareto fronts. In this paper, a novel dominance relation is proposed
  to better balance convergence and diversity for evolutionary many-objective optimization.
  In the proposed dominance relation, an adaptive niching technique is developed based
  on the angles between the candidate solutions, where only the best converged candidate
  solution is identified to be nondominated in each niche. Experimental results demonstrate
  that the proposed dominance relation outperforms existing dominance relations in
  balancing convergence and diversity. A modified NSGA-II is suggested based on the
  proposed dominance relation, which shows competitiveness against the state-of-the-art
  algorithms in solving many-objective optimization problems. The effectiveness of
  the proposed dominance relation is also verified on several other existing multi-
  and many-objective evolutionary algorithms.

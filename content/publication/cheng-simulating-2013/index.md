abstract: Competitive particle swarm optimizer (ComPSO) is a novel swarm intelligence
  algorithm that does not need any memory. Different from the canonical particle swarm
  optimizer (PSO), neither gbest nor pbest needs to be stored in ComPSO, and the algorithm
  is extremely simple in implementation. ComPSO has shown to be highly scalable to
  the search dimension. In the original ComPSO, two particles are randomly chosen
  to compete. This work investigates the influence of the competition rule on the
  search performance of ComPSO and proposes a new competition rule operating on a
  sorted swarm with neighborhood control. Empirical studies have been performed on
  a set of widely used test functions to compare the new competition rule with the
  random strategy. Results show that the new competition rule can speed up the convergence
  with a big neighborhood size, while with a small neighborhood size, the convergence
  speed can be slowed down.

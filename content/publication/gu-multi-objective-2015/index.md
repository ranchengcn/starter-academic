abstract: 'Ensemble methods that combine a committee of machine-learning models, each
  known as a member or base learner, have gained research interests in the past decade.
  One interest on ensemble generation involves the multi-objective approach, which
  attempts to generate both accurate and diverse members that fulfill the theoretical
  requirements of good ensembles. These methods resolve common difficulties of balancing
  the trade-off between accuracy and diversity and have been shown to be advantageous
  over single-objective methods. This study presents an up-to-date survey on multi-objective
  ensemble generation methods, including widely used diversity measures, member generation,
  selection, and integration techniques. Challenges and potential applications of
  multi-objective ensemble generation are also discussed. WIREs Data Mining Knowl

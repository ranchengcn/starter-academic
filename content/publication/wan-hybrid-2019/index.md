abstract: Many real-world optimization problems are challenging because the evaluation
  of solutions is computationally expensive. As a result, the number of function evaluations
  is limited. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms are promising approaches
  to tackle this kind of problems. However, their performance highly depends on the
  number of objectives. Thus, they may not be suitable for many-objective optimization.
  This paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for computationally expensive many-objective
  optimization, called C-M-EA. The proposed approach combines two surrogate-assisted
  evolutionary algorithms during the search process. We compare the performance of
  the proposed approach with seven multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Our experimental
  results show that our approach is competitive for solving computationally expensive
  many-objective optimization problems.

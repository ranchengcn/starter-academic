abstract: Sexual reproduction plays an important role in evolution. However, in classic
  genetic algorithms(GAs), the evolutionary process is only implemented on an unisexual
  population. Although some sexual selection schemes for GAs have been proposed, only
  limited studies are focused on detailed mechanisms in sexual selection. In this
  paper, we focus on the modeling of some significant components in sexual selection,
  including the concepts of male trait, female mating preference. Thereafter, a novel
  evolutionary framework is constructed based on these models. The theoretical principle
  of this framework is the famous mechanism called Fisher's runaway process. Numeric
  optimization is carried out to evaluate the newly proposed framework on a large
  number of benchmark functions used in CEC2005 Special Session. Comparing with a
  classic real-coded genetic algorithm, the novel framework outperforms it on most
  functions. Although this framework is very preliminary, it has shown good potential
  in solving optimization problems.

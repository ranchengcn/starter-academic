abstract: 'Over the last three decades, a large number of evolutionary algorithms
  have been developed for solving multi-objective optimization problems. However,
  there lacks an upto-date and comprehensive software platform for researchers to
  properly benchmark existing algorithms and for practitioners to apply selected algorithms
  to solve their real-world problems. The demand of such a common tool becomes even
  more urgent, when the source code of many proposed algorithms has not been made
  publicly available. To address these issues, we have developed a MATLAB platform
  for evolutionary multi-objective optimization in this paper, called PlatEMO, which
  includes more than 50 multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and more than 100 multi-objective
  test problems, along with several widely used performance indicators. With a user-friendly
  graphical user interface, PlatEMO enables users to easily compare several evolutionary
  algorithms at one time and collect statistical results in Excel or LaTeX files.
  More importantly, PlatEMO is completely open source, such that users are able to
  develop new algorithms on the basis of it. This paper introduces the main features
  of PlatEMO and illustrates how to use it for performing comparative experiments,
  embedding new algorithms, creating new test problems, and developing performance
  indicators. Source code of PlatEMO is now available at: http://bimk.ahu.edu.cn/index.php?s=/Index/Software/index.html.'

abstract: While most part of the complex network models are described in function
  of some growth mechanism, the optimization of a goal or certain characteristics
  can be desirable for some problems. This paper investigates structural optimization
  of networks in the highlevel classification context, where the classification produced
  by a traditional classifier is combined with the classification provided by complex
  network measures. Using the recently proposed social learning particle swarm optimization
  (SL-PSO), a bio-inspired optimization framework, which is responsible to build up
  the network and adjust the parameters of the hybrid model while conducting the optimization
  of a quality function, is proposed. Experiments on two real-world problems, the
  Handwritten Digits Recognition and the Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), were performed.
  In both problems, the optimization framework is able to improve the classification
  given by a state-of-the-art algorithm to SRL. Furthermore, the optimization framework
  proposed here can be extended to other machine learning tasks.

 abstract = {While most part of the complex network models are described in function of some growth mechanism, the optimization of a goal or certain characteristics can be desirable for some problems. This paper investigates structural optimization of networks in the highlevel classification context, where the classification produced by a traditional classifier is combined with the classification provided by complex network measures. Using the recently proposed social learning particle swarm optimization (SL-PSO), a bio-inspired optimization framework, which is responsible to build up the network and adjust the parameters of the hybrid model while conducting the optimization of a quality function, is proposed. Experiments on two real-world problems, the Handwritten Digits Recognition and the Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), were performed. In both problems, the optimization framework is able to improve the classification given by a state-of-the-art algorithm to SRL. Furthermore, the optimization framework proposed here can be extended to other machine learning tasks.},

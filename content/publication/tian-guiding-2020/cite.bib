 abstract = {In evolutionary multiobjective optimization, the Pareto front (PF) is approximated by using a set of representative candidate solutions with good convergence and diversity. However, most existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have general difficulty in the approximation of PFs with complicated geometries. To address this issue, we propose a generic front modeling method for evolutionary multiobjective optimization, where the shape of the nondominated front is estimated by training a generalized simplex model. On the basis of the estimated front, we further develop an MOEA, where both the mating selection and environmental selection are driven by the approximate nondominated fronts modeled during the optimization process. For performance assessment, the proposed algorithm is compared with several state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms on a wide range of benchmark problems with various types of PFs and different numbers of objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs consistently on a variety of multiobjective optimization problems.},

abstract: In evolutionary multiobjective optimization, the Pareto front (PF) is approximated
  by using a set of representative candidate solutions with good convergence and diversity.
  However, most existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have general
  difficulty in the approximation of PFs with complicated geometries. To address this
  issue, we propose a generic front modeling method for evolutionary multiobjective
  optimization, where the shape of the nondominated front is estimated by training
  a generalized simplex model. On the basis of the estimated front, we further develop
  an MOEA, where both the mating selection and environmental selection are driven
  by the approximate nondominated fronts modeled during the optimization process.
  For performance assessment, the proposed algorithm is compared with several state-of-the-art
  evolutionary algorithms on a wide range of benchmark problems with various types
  of PFs and different numbers of objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that
  the proposed algorithm performs consistently on a variety of multiobjective optimization
  problems.

abstract: With the rising number of large-scale multiobjective optimization problems
  from academia and industries, some evolutionary algorithms (EAs) with different
  decision variable handling strategies have been proposed in recent years. They mainly
  emphasize the balance between convergence enhancement and diversity maintenance
  for multiobjective optimization but ignore the local search tailored for large-scale
  optimization. Consequently, most existing EAs can hardly obtain the global or local
  optima. To address this issue, we propose an efficient sampling-based offspring
  generation method for large-scale multiobjective optimization, where convergence
  enhancement and diversity maintenance, together with ad hoc local search, are considered.
  First, the decision variables are dynamically classified into two types for solving
  large-scale decision space in a divide-and-conquer manner. Then, a convergence-related
  sampling strategy is designed to handle those decision variables related to convergence
  enhancement. Two additional sampling strategies are proposed for diversity maintenance
  and local search, respectively. Experimental results on problems with up to 5000
  decision variables have indicated the effectiveness of the algorithm in large-scale
  multiobjective optimization.

abstract: As a typical large-scale multiobjective optimization problem extracted from
  real-world applications, the voltage transformer ratio error estimation (TREE) problem
  is challenging for existing evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Due to the large number
  of decision variables in the problems, existing algorithms cannot solve TREE problems
  efficiently. Besides, most EAs may fail to balance the convergence enhancement and
  diversity maintenance, leading to the trap in local optima even at the early stage
  of the evolution. This work proposes an adaptive large-scale multiobjective EA (LSMOEA)
  to handle the TREE problems with thousands of decision variables. Generally, multiple
  efficient offspring generation and environmental selection strategies selected from
  some representative LSMOEAs are included. Then an adaptive selection strategy is
  used to determine which offspring generation and environmental selection operators
  are used in each generation of the evolution. Thus, the search behavior of the proposed
  algorithm evolves along with the evolution process, the balance between convergence
  and diversity is maintained, and the proposed algorithm is expected to solve TREE
  problems effectively and efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed
  algorithm achieves significant performance improvement due to the adaptive selection
  of different operators, providing an effective and efficient approach for large-scale
  optimization problems.

abstract: This article presents the second Part of a two-Part survey that reviews
  evolutionary dynamic optimization (EDO) for single-objective unconstrained continuous
  problems over the last two decades. While in the first part, we reviewed the components
  of dynamic optimization algorithms (DOAs); in this part, we present an in-depth
  review of the most commonly used benchmark problems, performance analysis methods,
  static optimization methods used in the framework of DOAs, and real-world applications.
  Compared to the previous works, this article provides a new taxonomy for the benchmark
  problems used in the field based on their baseline functions and dynamics. In addition,
  this survey classifies the commonly used performance indicators into fitness/error-based
  and efficiency-based ones. Different types of plots used in the literature for analyzing
  the performance and behavior of algorithms are also reviewed. Furthermore, the static
  optimization algorithms that are modified and utilized in the framework of DOAs
  as the optimization components are covered. We then comprehensively review some
  real-world dynamic problems that are optimized by EDO methods. Finally, some challenges
  and opportunities are pointed out for future directions.
